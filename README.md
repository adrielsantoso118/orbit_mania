# Orbit Mania

"Orbit Mania" is a space-themed arcade game where the player controls a spacecraft, dodging asteroids while managing fuel consumption. This report provides an overview of the game's objectives, background inspiration, theoretical concepts, and code explanation.

This game was inspired by the concept of the Hohmann transfer, which I encountered last spring break while exploring my curiosity about orbital mechanics. It refers to a space maneuver used to transfer a spacecraft between two orbits of different radii about a central body while conserving fuel.
